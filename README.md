# Password Generator

## Description

This is a website that generates a password upon the users click, and allows the user to view it. It also gives you options on the numbers, letters, legnth of the password and special characters you want to use.

- My motivation to build this Password Generator and make it functional was to be able to get more familiar with with JavaScript and to build applications in the futer like this.
